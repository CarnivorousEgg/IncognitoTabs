# IncognitoTabs

## Features

6-Wheel Drive System:
Our rover uses a robust 6-wheel drive system, allowing it to traverse challenging terrains efficiently.

Weight:
According to our ANSYS simulation, the rover weighs approximately 6.5 kg.

Autonomous Navigation:
Equipped with obstacle detection, path planning, and localization algorithms.
Combining ROS and the Bug2 path planning algorithm, we’ve created a fully functional autonomous robot.
Inputs from the LiDAR sensor provide distance information, and the rover responds with speed adjustments.
The rover follows an array of x and y coordinates as its goal, navigating through multiple waypoints until reaching the final destination
