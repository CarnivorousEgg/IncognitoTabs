This rover project utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 and an Arduino UNO R3 for seamless automation and motor control. The Raspberry Pi 4 is responsible for executing high-level automation tasks, including computer vision, path planning, and running ROS 2. It communicates with the Arduino UNO R3 via the I2C protocol, sending precise instructions for motor operation. The Arduino, in turn, processes these signals and controls the rover's motors through an L298N motor driver, ensuring smooth and accurate movement. :)
